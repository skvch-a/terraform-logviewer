# Implementation Summary

This document describes the changes made to implement the 4 requested features.

## Task 1: Lazy Loading for Request Groups

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `GET /api/request-ids` endpoint that returns a list of unique request IDs with metadata (log count, start/end timestamps)
- Added `GET /api/logs/by-request/{request_id}` endpoint to fetch logs for a specific request ID
- Both endpoints handle the special case of logs without request_id (labeled as "no-request-id")

**Frontend Changes:**
- Updated `LogViewer` component to support lazy loading mode
- When grouping is enabled and no filters are applied, the component now:
  1. Fetches only the list of request IDs (not the full logs)
  2. Shows collapsed `<details>` elements by default
  3. Loads logs for a specific request ID only when the user opens that group
- Added loading indicators for each group being loaded
- Added timestamp display in group summaries

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/log_router.py` - Added 2 new endpoints
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added API functions
- `frontend/src/components/LogViewer.js` - Implemented lazy loading logic

## Task 2: Disable Grouping by request_id

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `group_by_request_id` boolean query parameter to `GET /api/logs` endpoint (default: true)
- Modified `get_all_logs()` in `log_service.py` to:
  - Order by `tf_req_id, timestamp` when grouping is enabled
  - Order by `timestamp` only when grouping is disabled

**Frontend Changes:**
- Added toggle button to enable/disable grouping in the UI
- When grouping is disabled:
  - Shows a flat list of logs sorted by timestamp
  - Displays request_id as metadata in each log entry
  - Uses different styling for flat view vs grouped view

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/api/log_router.py` - Added parameter
- `backend/app/services/log_service.py` - Modified ordering logic
- `frontend/src/components/LogViewer.js` - Added toggle and flat view

## Task 3: Warning for Fixed Logs

**Backend Changes:**
- Modified `fix_log_sequence()` to return a tuple: `(fixed_logs, fixed_count)`
- The function now tracks how many log entries had missing fields that were automatically filled
- Updated `parse_terraform_log()` to return the fixed count
- Updated `LogUploadResponse` and `LogWithSectionsResponse` schemas to include `fixed_logs_count` field
- Both upload and sections endpoints now return this information

**Frontend Changes:**
- Updated `FileUpload` component to display a warning message when `fixed_logs_count > 0`
- Warning appears inline with the success message using ⚠️ emoji
- Also shows in sections view when data is loaded from DB

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/services/log_fixing.py` - Modified return type and tracking
- `backend/app/services/log_service.py` - Updated to handle tuple returns
- `backend/app/api/log_router.py` - Pass fixed count to response
- `backend/app/schemas/log_schemas.py` - Added field to schemas
- `frontend/src/components/FileUpload.js` - Display warning

## Task 4: Sections Parser Using Database

**Backend Changes:**
- Added `get_sections_from_db()` function in `log_service.py` that:
  1. Fetches all logs from the database
  2. Converts them to the dict format expected by section analysis
  3. Runs the same section detection logic as the file parser
  4. Returns data in the same format as the file parser
- Added `GET /api/sections` endpoint that returns sections from DB
- Exported the new function in `services/__init__.py`

**Frontend Changes:**
- Completely refactored `SectionsView` component to:
  - Use database data instead of requiring file upload
  - Accept `refreshTrigger` prop to reload when new data is uploaded
  - Display "Refresh Data" button (like GanttView)
  - Show appropriate messages when no data is available
- Updated `App.js` to add `FileUpload` component to sections view
- Added `getSectionsData()` API function

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/services/log_service.py` - Added get_sections_from_db()
- `backend/app/services/__init__.py` - Exported new function
- `backend/app/api/log_router.py` - Added endpoint
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added API function
- `frontend/src/components/SectionsView.js` - Complete refactor
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added FileUpload to sections view

## Testing

All changes have been validated:
- ✅ Backend Python code compiles without syntax errors
- ✅ Frontend React code builds successfully
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ Type signatures are consistent

## Migration Notes

No database migrations are required. All changes are backwards compatible.

## API Documentation Updates Needed

The following endpoints should be added to the API documentation:
- `GET /api/request-ids` - Get list of request IDs with metadata
- `GET /api/logs/by-request/{request_id}` - Get logs for specific request ID
- `GET /api/sections` - Get sections data from database
- Update `GET /api/logs` to document the new `group_by_request_id` parameter
